A weather app test for Herolo, built using React.  
The commits are not up to par compared to my regular workflow as i have been sick and had a troublesome week :/  
Usually i'll commit after every working feature and push after a section is done.  
Saw more problems and errors than any other project or
assignment i ever had, and I'm happy for it because I've learned so much from this, stuff like Redux and state management, using different api requests, using postman to check the api requests, basic error handling and much more.
Had a blast working on this!
